 <h2>Few reasons why you should visit New York</h2>
 <div class="wrapper">
 <p>From the stunning, high-end hotels, to the plethora of nightlife attractions, the different districts,
     and the hum of city life that is a main attraction of New York City, this is a popular destination for great reason.
     Something that a lot of New York lovers will tell you, is that you’ve got to see all five boroughs in New York to truly have the whole experience. A lot of new visitors will gravitate towards Manhattan, but there is so much more to explore when you visit Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island.

     In the Bronx you have the New York Botanical Gardens, a gorgeous place rife with life and colour, in the middle of a towering city, it’s a very unique sight. There’s also the Bronx Zoo, to keep up those natural vibes.
     
     In Queens you will find a splendid array of different restaurants to eat at, all with a different flavour. And this isn’t just local foods, Queens is well known and loved for its wide selection of foods from around the world. From Italian, to Greek, American, Polish, Turkish and many more, you won’t tire of all the different foodie experiences there.
     
     Manhattan is definitely the hotspot heaven of New York. This is where the classic sights are, a lot of the biggest, popular hotels will also be in Manhattan. It’s certainly not a borough to miss or bypass if you want a true taste of the New York character.
     
     Brooklyn is your modern spot in New York without a doubt. This is where the latest trends in fashion, arts, and more will be found, and it’s also got a lot more luscious greenery than some other boroughs like Manhattan.
     
     Finally, Staten Island is of course home to the Staten Island ferry, a great trip to see some of the sights of the city from a distance and enjoy the waters that run through and around the different boroughs of the city.

    <p>After your walk down Broadway out of Hotel Edison, one of the classic characteristics of New York City that is a truly humbling experience, is walking through the city to witness all the towering skyscrapers. After this, scaling them (from the inside, of course) is an experience not for those with a fear of heights.

        The Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building are definitely the most well-known of these structures, but by far not the only ones. The Empire State Building is one that we recommend you don’t miss, however. To be at the top of such a historical, and imposing building, it’s astonishing. Plus, you can see the city from on high when you reach the top, and that in itself is a majestic sight, being at the top of a city you had to gaze up at a little while ago.
        
        Even taller than this, is the One World Observatory. This is a much more modernly designed building, where you might visit the Empire State Building for the history as much as the view, this is a building that will offer you one of the best views of New York you would hope for. And it is beautifully designed too.</p>

   <p>One of the classic, majestic sights of New York City has got to be Brooklyn Bridge. Not just a journey from one borough to a whole other world in the next, but a journey over the great East River as well.

    This is an instantly recognisable part of the New York skyline, next to many other iconic sights, and it’s one that has been featured in a lot of media and film too. Though a lot of films and shows set in New York will usually be filmed in the streets of another American city, the Brooklyn Bridge is such a classic part of the skyline that footage of it is often used in wide shots so audiences can immediately identify New York.
    
    It also connects the centre of New York City tourism, Manhattan, with Brooklyn, a whole other world, and home to places like DUMBO, where the artistic heart of Brooklyn blossoms among art galleries and independent book stores for your creative soul to enjoy.</p>
